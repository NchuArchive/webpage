    h1.title 校史館緣起
    p 本校歷史悠久，1919年日本當局為開發臺灣農林資源、培養農林人才，乃在臺北設立「臺灣總督府農林專門學校」，1922年改制為「臺灣總督府高等農林學校」，1928年併入「臺北帝國大學」（今國立臺灣大學），為附屬農林專門部。1943年獨立設校，名為「臺灣總督府臺中高等農林學校」，並遷至臺中頂橋子頭。戰後，更名為「臺灣省立臺中農業專科學校」，1946年改為「臺灣省立農學院」。1961年增設理工學院，並與臺北的法商學院（原省立地方行政專校）合併成為「臺灣省立中興大學」。1971年改制成「國立中興大學」，發展迄今，已成為具有文、農資、理、工、生命科學、獸醫、管理、法政等八大學院的綜合型大學，在中部地區首屈一指。然而，長期以來並未有專門場所收藏並展示與學校歷史相關的文物，直到2009年，為慶祝九十週年校慶，校史館才告成立。
    p 校史館位於惠蓀堂一樓，佔地約一百二十坪，耗資七百餘萬元佈置而成，但因人手不足，僅採取預約開放機制，多數師生難以一窺堂奧。去年(2011) 8月，圖書館校史館組成立，決定在增強防護措施與更換部分展品後，定時開放校史館，如今總算大功告成。
    p 校史館展區為長條型，以「憶的長廊」為設計概念，置身其中猶如走進時光隧道，可親眼見證學校的演變。在展品部分，首先，保存有學校各時期的校門牌，包括「臺灣省立農學院」、「臺灣省立中興大學」、「國立中興大學」，有些是從標購廢品商人處重新尋回的，得之極為不易。其次，收藏三本日治時期畢業紀念冊的複製品，是極為珍貴的校史文物。再者，有專區介紹歷任校長、學校四季的代表植物、各時期的空照圖與校園建築、過往學生生活的樣貌等等。此外，展示兩臺早期教學用的顯微鏡，其中一臺係1959年時，以一萬美金由臺灣省警務處刑事警察大隊購入，曾協助警方偵破東勢女童命案等重大刑案。總之，凡是本校教職員生，不可不到此一訪，校史館竭誠歡迎您。
    p Our school has a long history. In order to develop Taiwan's agricultural and forestry resources and relative talents, the Japanese authorities established the "Taiwan Soutokufu School of Agronomy and Forestry" in Taipei in 1919. In 1928, we were merged into the "Taipei Imperial University" (today National Taiwan University), as the affiliated department of agriculture and forestry.
    p In 1943, we were independent as "Taiwan Soutokufu Taichung School of Agronomy and Forestry" and moved to Dingqiaozitou of Taichung. After World War II, we were renamed "Taiwan Provincial Taichung School of Agronomy and Forestry", and was changed to "Taiwan Provincial College of Agriculture" in 1946. In 1961, we merged with Taipei's School of Law and Business (formerly the Provincial School of Local Administration) and added polytechnic Institute to form the "Taiwan Provincial Chung Hsing University". In 1971, it was restructured into the "National Chung Hsing University" and finally became a comprehensive university with eight colleges including liberal arts, agriculture and natural resources, science, engineering, life sciences, veterinary medicine, management, and law and politics. We may be second to none in Taiwan central. However, there has been no special place to collect and display cultural relics related to the school history for a long time. The Gallery of University History was not established until 2009 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of National Chung Hsing University.
    p The Gallery of University History is located in the first floor of Huisun Hall with an area of about 120 square meters and costs about 7 million. Due to lack of manpower, gallery was opened only by appointment at the beginning and was not so convenient to visitor.In August of 2011, the University Archives & Special Collections of the library was established and decided to open regularly after strengthening protective measures and replacing some exhibits. Now it is finally done.
    p Our exhibition zone is shaped as a long strip with the design concept of past hardships. Being in it, it is like walking into a time tunnel to witness the evolution of our school. In the exhibits, first of all, the school signs of the different periods are preserved, including "Taiwan Provincial College of College", "Taiwan Provincial Chung Hsing University", "National Chung Hsing University", and some of them were brought from the scrap merchant, which are extremely difficult to obtain. Secondly, the collection of 3 copies of the graduation albums during the period of Japanese rule is an extremely precious school history artifact. We also introduce past principals, representative plants of our school in different seasons, aerial photos and campus buildings of each period, past student life, and so on. In addition, two early teaching microscopes were displayed, one of which was purchased by the Criminal Police Brigade of the Taiwan Provincial Police Department for US$10,000 in 1959. It assisted the police in investigating major criminal cases such as the murder of a Dongshi girl. In short, all faculty and students of our school must not miss this visit. The Gallery of University History wholeheartedly welcomes you.
